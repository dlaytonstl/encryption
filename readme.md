I was looking for a fun python project to build on and I stumbled across ndleah' Caeser Cipher (https://github.com/ndleah/python-mini-project/blob/main/Caesar_Cipher/Caesar_cipher.py)

The orignal cipher only had an encrypt function I added a decrypt one as well. From there I decided to turn this into a website built using Flask and hosted on Azure.

I also added a password generator

I plan on adding more to this and trying out other encryption methods and other things I haven't thought about yet!

Have fun!!
